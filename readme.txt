Schedule and automate posts across social networks. Unlimited features and extensibility. Works with X, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn.

== Description ==
Take your social media game to the next level with Social Engine - the ultimate scheduling tool for your content and photos! And it's completely free! Unlike other tools like TweetDeck, Buffer, Falcon, and ContentCal, Social Engine has no limitations on scheduling posts. You have full control of the system once it's installed on your WordPress, and you can even customize it to your needs with easy-to-use coding.

Currently, it supports:

- Instagram
- Facebook
- X (Twitter)
- Mastodon
- LinkedIn (Pro Version)
- Pinterest (Pro Version)

Current features:

- Plan your SNS Posts with a pretty UI
- Create Post with Photos
- Automatically schedule your WP Posts
- Select images which has never been published on SNS
- Revive your old content
- Draft Support (Pro Version)
- Statistics, such views and likes (Pro Version)
- Revive Posts or Pages (Pro Version)

*Consider the Pro Version for additional one-to-one support, and to help me developing it. This plugin is, as you can guess, quite a lot of work! Many companies are running expensive platforms for the same services. I think they are way too expensive and not always made, so this is my attempt to make things cheaper and better. I need you!*

== No third-party service ðŸ’• ==
Say goodbye to third-party services with Social Engine. Enjoy no limitations, no hidden costs (except for the optional Pro version), and the security of keeping your data to yourself. Plus, you can customize and automate everything to fit your specific needs. Note that you'll need to create your own "Facebook App" (and the same goes for Twitter, Instagram, etc.) It's easy and straightforward, and if you need any help, just check out my tutorial or ask a friend for assistance! ðŸ¤“

=== Extensibility ===
We provide actions, filters and an API so that you can extend the plugin the way you like. Please let us know what you would like to do, and we'll give you everything you need. Please check the section about extensibility in the [documentation](https://meowapps.com/social-engine/tutorial/#extensibility-api).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your WordPress.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu.
